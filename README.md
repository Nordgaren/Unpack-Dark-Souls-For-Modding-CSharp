# Unpack-Dark-Souls-For-Modding-CSharp
 UDSFM but in C#
 By Nordgaren
 
This tool uses modified code from [UXM](https://github.com/JKAnderson/UXM) and [Yabber](https://github.com/JKAnderson/Yabber).  
It will unpack the Dark Souls PTDE folder selected by the user and copy over the data files in the directory the EXE is run from.  

### Instructions
1) Put EXE in Dark Souls PTDE folder
2) Watch text scrull until it says completed

I made this so that it could be used in my [PTDE Mod Installer](https://github.com/Nordgaren/PTDE-Mod-Installer)

### Thank You
